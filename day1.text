HTTP/1.1 :
     HTTP 1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.
     
HTTP/2 : 
      HTTP.2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other
          resource.


Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

      * JavaScript is an object-based language. Almost everything in JavaScript is an object or behaves like one. Objects are essentially
  collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or symbol) and each value can be any data type, including other objects. 
  This flexible structure makes objects a powerful tool for organizing and managing complex data structures.
      * JavaScript engines use various techniques to represent objects efficiently. One common approach is the use of hash maps or 
  dictionaries. Each property of an object is stored as a key-value pair in this map.When you access a property, the engine looks 
  up the key in the map to retrieve the corresponding value.
